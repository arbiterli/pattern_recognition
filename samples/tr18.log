I almost since the beginning of the problems with the BG Renderer function that blocks the use of Studio, I did not have this problem with Studio 17, now also suffers this problem because it is still installed in parallel with 18 studio. As I professionally use this software I can not afford to be blocked. Should I uninstall and reinstall the software two studio 18 and lose a lot of effects I have on studio 17, not to mention SmartSound? Thank you for quick response !!!!!!!!!

Following the registration of the product I received a code 22295526 I think that should be the code to support 14 days. However this code and refused when I want to use. It is also composed of 8 digits, when it should be 9. This is unfortunate because since the 18.0.1 update I have, among others, plus the disc menus.

I have 18 studio bought on the internet (download) on 23 October and installed. Also, the patch. I camp with two vexing problems. 1. If I move the cursor to a point in the timeline instead to cut and I select the clip jumps the cursor back to the previous cut point. 2. If I create a file of my project is to mpeg2 HD1080i then rendered to mpeg2 1920x1080 at 25 frames per second. It is also quite slow. How do I fix it? Martin Whistler

After installing the program, including the patch (18.0.1), the program does not start. It appears the loading screen for several seconds, with the initialization messages and then disappears. Since Windows is reporting that the program NGStudio crashed unexpectedly. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling as administrator by inhibiting the virus but the result does not change. I did register the product and the required support code, but I never received it. Not found in the spam mail or in any other folder.

Hello, I am running 64 bit windows 8.1. It took 2 days for me to download from you server. Your end is very very slow. I tried to install but setup file is saying it is corrupt and to download again. I have already downloaded this file twice now. I notice that the byte size during download does not match the completed byte size. I have attached screen shot of this install error. I have used your editingsoftware from the start many years ago and I use it for my work. I have to say I am a little bit annoyed to have such problems in this late stage of product development. I was going to buy the package and get it delivered, I have always done it that way on every version but because I was eager in getting this and using it I decided to download it. It was a big mistake I must say. Probably worth theextra dollars to get the disc and not waste time downloading. Please advise what I can do to fix this problem. My details are below. Thankyou in advance. I really want to get this software loaded ASAP.

How do I fix the problem - uninstall the version (or all the installations of the new version) and try again from scratch or can I just uninstall the Bonus and download the English version (hopefully the link can be sent to me)?

For one, I have not received a 9-digit support code that I could use for the online form. (I can also entertain with the English support). I have to make problems installing on Windows 8.1. The message I get says: databa. The Launch Condition table in the SQL query could not be loaded: SELECT 'Condition', 'Description' FROM'Launch Condition'. I have the installer de-installed and re-attempt the installation. Same error I was not sure if the download files are clean, I then made the installation on a Windows 7 machine, with absolutely no problems. Now I have deleted the software there again, because I want to have 8.1 on the Windows machine and there always comes the error.

Unfortunately, I get the run of the installation continuously an abort message with the following content: Database:. The Launch Condition table could not be loaded into the SQL query: SELECT `condition`, Description`` FROM `LaunchCondition` How can this errorbe fixed? To my system: Win7, 64 bit 6 GB RAM Intel i7 920 @ 2.67 GHz A hotline that can be reached for a German support, I could not find it. Would you please also tell me the phone number?

I purchased Studio 17 Plus one month ago, then last week was offered a discounted "upgrade" to version 18, so I paid the extra $30. Is this some kind of bad joke? There is absolutely NO DIFFERENCE between the 2 versions with exception of the launch splash screen that now says 18 instead of 17 - $30 for a number change? BOO Pinnacle - and BOO Corel for not managing your acquisitions more closely. I have been upgrading Studio since version 8, but this sick trick to swindle more money has just lost you a loyal customer for good!

Hello, I purchased the downloadable version of Pinnacle 18 Ultimate. After long hours I get a file 'exe', never the same size. I downloaded the files because every time I install the program (64 or 32 bit) I get to the end of the installation starts, the message that the file is corrupted several times. All my versions are downloaded and I never had this problem. What should I do to the file s in good condition.

Hi Support, I'm having great difficulty in downloading the required files. I've tried several times now, both daytime and night time, and the best download speed I can get is 8-9KB/sec. It seem to start at the 9Kb/s level and than slowly gets slower and slower till it's at zero. A pause and resume will not reset the speed to 9Kb. I've been unable to successfully load any of the files yet. Is thereanother server or network pathway I could try as each file would take over 12 hours to download, if it didn't fail 10% or so into the download process; requiring me to restart? MOST FRUSTRATING! I have no problem with other vendors, including international ones so the problem is not likely to be at my end. I have a 8Mb fibre connection and other downloads take a matter of minutes. Network checks andtests throw up the following results: "In general this route is reasonably quick, with hops responding on average within 154ms. However, all hops after hop 10 in network 'Cable

I enclose an email sent to Digital River noting the problems downloading Studio 18 Customer service team. I am having terrible trouble downloading the software for Pinnacle Studio18 Ultimate. The download speed is so slow (around 6 hours for each file) that it is like using equipment from the dark ages. I can normally download a file of this size in a few minutes. It took 4 or 5 attempts to load thesetup file and the same for the content file. When I finally got the bonus file to complete it would not load and was reporting as corrupt. When I finished pulling my hair out in frustration I gave it one more go, only to be told that I had exceeded the maximum number of attempts-I think you could probably heard the scream all the way across the Atlantic. When I downloaded Studio 17 when it first cameout, I had no trouble whatsoever, so what has gone so terribly wrong this time? Can you please help me obtain the software that I have paid for.

Hello support, As described to you by Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/PinnacleSys/posts/821186584599435), version PSU 18 is not working well. Well, it is not usable at all. - The program crashes at random moments, sometimes crashes are reproducable. This program cannot be used to make a short movie: while editing the program keeps crashing. - I cannot cut a scene using the N-key: if using more tracks,and you want to select only 1 track, the cursor is moved to the 1st frame of the scene, instead of keeping the cursor on the selected position. This error occurred in version 17 as I remember, and was solved in one of the patches. Now it reoccurs... - using more tracks, when the system starts rendering and you remove a scene (which is being rendered) from one of the tracks, the program is not awareof that and tries to keep on rendering. The rendering process keeps running, without progress of course. The program has to be cancelled (if it doesn't do so itself). - The database of my 17.5-version is not imported into the 18.0.1-version. - When saving a project, the (newly created) choosen path is inserted in the controlpanel as default path. I am not very interested in fancy tab-colors or newadd-ins, that are probably no longer supported in future versions, but I would like my PSU-version to work properly. My PC meets the requirements and has DirectX Version 11 activated. Kind regards, Cees.

I got the email with the download links, I had started to download Pinnacle Studio Ultimate 64-bit (the option wasn't available in the drop downs of this form) it took over a day to download. When I started the install it comes back and says file corrupted re-download. I tried that yesterday, unfortunately my PC rebooted around the 70% mark and lost it. I went to the email to try and download againand the links are no longer there. I did pay for extended download, now I'm wondering why I just didn't by the DVD clearly your server is not set up to supply suitable downloads. I was chatting to one of your people yesterday Alexander and he said he's set up a support case number 02178311, however today I can not find it, nor have I received any emails from you ?

Since the first download was a bit bumpy (approx 20 hours with several interruptions, server crash and a wretched transfer rate of 20KB / s), and I have the suspicion that the software has been damaged, I tried downloading them again. When I try to "pinnaclesys.com" Support the software (Studio 18) re-download I land at Corel. When I log in thereI find my order Studio 14 Studio 18 from 2011, although already registered = nil. An access from the Pinnacle help leads to the result: "wrong order number and / or password" (I have taken from the order confirmation). When I go directly from Digital River via "www.findmyorder.com", I even find my order again. Download a trial ends with theErgebnisse: "Notes Found The Requested URL /wgt/9B5A4FCEF11DA80C/171F14235882A3D34841170D5B9DEF7B204E34DFBA1346588D273C5554AF2095B1F140B145B153A8B0743F921EF65C62215E42AA16EE2A82D66E275443D504BCF891550673B9EF4E797C48ABA5EE99798F5DC70B1E40C906/pinnsys/PinnacleStudio18_ULT_64bit_Setup.exe ward notes found on this server.

sorry i don't have the support code. i spent all evening with your chat service and they sent the e-mail a couple of times, but i never got it. i have a number of mp4 videos that i created in Studio 17. after a recent patch of Studio 17, most of those mp4's turned red or green in the library and wouldn't show the video any longer. i decided instead of troubleshooting the 17 ultimate, i just upgradedto 18 ultimate hoping that'd fix the problem. it still exists and even some mp4s that i could use in 17 will not work now in 18 ultimate. i did the usual things as far as resetting the library and effects and such. of course, with 18 i was starting with a whole new library too. now i need help fixing it. i've googled all over the internet but i can't find anything to help. thank you, John Reel

Warranty code: 175421271 I am getting an error message when loading software. It is a new laptop (Windows). The error message code is 1935. The install nearly gets finished when this message comes up. I have looked into the issue with stopping the Windows Installer file but I can't do it for some reason. I had installed Studio 16 with a Studio 17 upgrade, but then the Studio 18 was released so I uninstalled the 16 and 17 and tried to install a complete copy of 18 Ultimate, but get the above 1935 error message. Any help would be appreciated in sorting this problem out.

Seeing similar problems as Case Number 02091729 (Pinnacle 17), even tho now running on an Asus desktop with much more power and memory. Import has failed completely after processing about 1000 ".MOD" clips. Programme will now not start beyond initial "do you want to abandon last activity" message. All thumbnails now show only the blue video camera symbol before the whole screen whites out. Looks a more generic problem than the low processor/memory problem we thought before.

The Studio 18 Importer sees the camera device but does not see the internal directory structure and thus cannot see any media files. Hoping I am doing something stupid. Need input. Phil Dunton Tucson

Hello, I have got Pinnacle S18 Plus since yesterday and have to admit it is faster than S16 which I had before. Unfortunatelly, I experienced a failure during export of a clip in HD (MP4) from timiline to 1080 HD-file. All was doing well until the moment when the export came to a slow-motion piece (speed 42%). It stopped and announced an error which I couldn´t skip and finish the export. I tried to change the speed of that subclip (accelerate and decelerate) but it made no difference.

There are several problems (as usual): 1. Your problem submission protocol doesn't include Pinnacle Studio Ultimate 18. Therefore cannot supply proper product ID. 2. Your support structure assumes you will have no problems with your software which would require tech support to resolve. So WRONG! We need a tech support contact, as is evidenced by continued issues with this product (beginning with PinnacleStudio products after Vs 14.) 3. Had quit using Pinnacle Studio after 20 years due to continued software glitches, esp. with Vs 17during EXPORT: 2x. Discovered a forced re-render aided with EXPORT. Was able to EXPORT 1x. Need to incorporate an ability to force rendering prior to EXPORT. C. Added sound tracks are not recognized during either playback OR EXPORT. And so...as you can see...your thoughtless one-time support protocol is NOT very helpful at all when it comes to resolving functional issues for which we shouldn't haveto be concerned about in the first place. You continue to sell faulty software, and simply don't seem to want to take responsibility for fixing it. Where do we go from here? Will you provide support in order to get us up and running with Pinnacle 18...or are you going to pass the buck to your so-called "user forums" (the blind leading the blind?). George

Hello, there are two problems, whenever I save my project and I look in the folder where I saved my project is there but as soon as I close Studio, files made remained but do not project. In short, whenever I lose the project. Then, in the plugins, RTFXV2, ProDAD folder, I have the plugin proDAD present in the library but there is no ProDAD or effects or Transitions. Thank you for your reply. Geert Claeys (GCVMP Forum Haunt)

Reporter: Allan Wright

Status: Waiting Customer Actions
Hi, I purchased Pinnacle Studio 18 recently and am grateful that it has fixed many of the bugs from version 17. Anyway, one of the old bugs from v17 remains but is actually much worse than it used to be:- Frequently, popup menus such as the right-click context menu in Edit mode stop appearing at the point of the mouse click. Instead - once this issue occurs - any popup window will appear at the top-leftof the screen until Pinnacle is restarted. This also applies to hover text showing file information, etc. This is annoying but not a show-stopper on its own. HOWEVER, once this bug starts occurring, any Export to File will also fail. When Export is clicked, a 0-byte video file will be created but no content written and the frame counter will stay on Total: 0% complete. The Preview frame moves everysecond or so, but nothing is actually working. Even after 30 minutes, I have to cancel the export, exit Pinnacle and restart before exporting will work properly. This generally occurs within 30 minutes of any editing session. I use Pinnacle 3-4 days per week, so having to kill and restart Pinnacle becomes extremely frustrating. NB: My main PC is Windows 7 64bit  but I have installed the 32bit versiononto a second PC as a test, and the same problem occurs. Also, I wish to request that a new Details view (as per Windows Explorer with filename, size and date shown as text) be provided for viewing Media instead of only a thumbnail view. I have many video clips and identifying which clip I need simply via a thumbnail image is difficult. I frequently give-up scanning thumbnails, and perform a QuickImport and use the Windows File Open dialog in Details view to re-import a clip I know I have previously imported. I can then spot the clip easily in the Recently Imported view. Regards, Allan Wright

Reporter: Gregory Shanos
Date: 27/10/2014 1:54 PM
Status: Closed - Resolved
Dear Technical Support: I just purchased Pinnacle Studio 18 ultimate and absolutely love the program. I am currently in the process of digitalizing my old Hi8 videos. I am able to successfully import from an old Sony Hi8/D8 camcorder using the Pinnacle MovieBox hardware. Once the video is captured from tape to .AVI format, I right click on the one hour video clip and click Detect Scenes then Content.The program successfully separates out every scene from the video clip and displays them within the Pinnacle program. For example a one hour video had 113 individual AVI clips. My question is that when I attempt to Export these individual clips to a folder on the computer Desktop, the program only allows me to Export one clip at a time. This is not feasible when you are dealing with 113 clips. Is thereany way that Pinnacle Studio 18 can export all 113 individual clips as .AVI files in sequence to the computer desktop? My goal is to make a folder with the entire one hour digitized AVI along with the 113 AVI clips in sequence. Is this possible with the current software? I not, could you update Pinnacle Studio 18 in the near future to support this feature? Additionally, where are these individual clipsstored within the Pinnacle Studio 18 folder on the C drive? For example C:\Program Files\Pinnacle\Studio 18\ etc. I may be able to find this subfolder and copy it onto the Desktop of the computer. This maybe the easier route. One last question, when digitalizing Hi8 tapes, there is an annoying horizontal line on the very bottom of the video (only a few millimeters in height). I did an internet searchand discovered that this line normally occurs due to the heads on the camcorder. Is there any way to eliminate this line? Could it be eliminated prior to import? If not, how could I use the software to eliminate this line post-processing. Look forward to hearing from you. Feel free to call me at (941) 383-0256 since I prefer a more interactive approach. Thank you. Respectfully submitted Gregory T. Shanos

I cannot register as I cannot load the software. Have tried on 4 other machines to download the 3 files. Every time I try to install them I get a message. "CRC failed in studio\Data1.cab" or a similar message on the other 2 files. This page seems to be the only way of contacting you, as I am unable to get the serial number of a program that I can't load. Hopefully you will be able to help me, as tryingto contact Pinnacle must be worse than trying to contact MI5. I have also in desperation purchased the backup copy. Having been a user since Studio 10, I wonder if i'm doing the right thing carrying on with this software. Regards Pete Voller

Transitions are fixed at 5 secs. Changing the transition time in the Control panel makes no difference. Also to edit a transition does not give ability to change its time. How can I change the time a transition takes? The default of 5 secs is useless.

System: Win7 Ultimate, i7, 12GB RAM, NVIDIA Geforce GTX 295 I work with two movie tracks, titles, and sound files: A) Studio crashes regularly after about 10 minutes (NGStudio not work anymore ...) B) If I have a track activate to cut these, the "cursor" jumps to the beginning of the track instead of staying there where he is positioned. Workaround is to set a mark, the trackactivate and then jump to the set mark, or activate the track before and then put the cursor to cut. Both are extremely cumbersome. In Avid Studio, it worked! C) Trim Does Not Operate (gray) D) genause when you open a title of the cursor at the beginning and not at the correct location on the Timeline .. More bugs is not yet observed.

When setting up a project, Project Settings, New Movie Settings, the drop down list shows 18 different options. Where in the Studio 17 User manual can one find out explanations of what these different settings accomplish for the user depending upon how or on what the user will show the video output? Explanations are critical to setting up a new project to get full use of big screen TV or computer monitor without black margins around the parameter of the movie project on the screen..
