Dear customer service, We had a problem in Pinnacle Studio 16 Ultimate and updated to PS17 Ultimate. We hoped that this problem was solved in the 17 version and the expected performance boost was very welcome. Our problem in both PS16 and PS17: 1. We placed a movie on the second AV-track then 2. placed a picture on the first AV-track about 20 sec from the start and extended the picture length to 40seconds then 3. we opened the effect editor on the picture by right clicking the picture then 4. We choose < Pan and Zoom > and then < 2 Animated > in the bar above the picture then 5. Adapted the from(green) to (red) zones to fit our wishes and with the oke button we returned to the main screen 6. While the pc starts to render we hit the timebar at 18 sec, just before the start of the picture andpress play in the previewwindow. In a lot of cases we directly hit the problem and get a error. If the problem doesnt come directly you can fit some extra pictures with this effect and the chance to hit the problem expands even further. The error said: NGStudio stopt working An error occurred therefore the program will not work properly. The program will close and a report will be presented when ansolution is available. After clicking the only option < shutdown program > we restarted the program and continued working. In controlpanel under Example we have these settings: Quality: Balanced Example on full screen: Main monitor External preview on: none-> none External preview standard: PAL Playbackoptimalisation: Optimalisationtreshhold: 100 Aggressive Render while playback: in the balanced settingmore errors than in the off setting Hardware acceleration: Activate: ON gives errors Activate: OFF in PS17 still free of errors Stereoscopic: Standard 3D-playbackmode: Anaglyph PC specification: Mainbord: Asus P9X79-WS rev. 1.03 Bios: 4404 date: 4 okt 2013 All drivers updated to latest 21 okt 2013 Processor: Intel I7 3930K 3,2 Ghz Memory: 32 Gb G.Skill Ribjaws Z F3-17000CL9-4GBZH (8 x4Gb) Harddisk:Crucial M4-CT256 SSD2 OS and Programs Seagate Barracuda 3 Tb 7200 rpm 64mb cache (4 x in RAID10) Videocard: Gygabyte GV-N66TOC-2GD-EU =NVidia GTX 660 TI latest driver 331.65 28 okt 2013 Powersupply: Corsair HX750 Operatingsystem: Windows 7 Ultimate (x64) Dutch Pinnacle serialnr: JBUAO-ABBAA-BFHFF-FEAAC-SVLJN Passport: 00019-16671-94500-05447-63077 Because we use a dutch OS and dutch Pinnacle versionI had to do the translations, Im sorry if the are not perfect and hope they are helpful.

Good Morning Corel, I am considering purchasing Corel First Pinnacle Video. The main use would be for its 3D Capabilities. I own a Fuji Fine Film REAL 3D W3 camera which takes 2D and 3D stills and movies. First Pinnacles seems to have to capabilities to edit and make movies in 3D. My Question Is? Does my laptop have the capabilities to use this product and view in 3D? My Laptop is SAMSUNG Model NP350V5CI run Windows 7 Intel ( R )HD Graphics 4000 Standard VGA Graphics Adapter ACPI x 64- Based PC Bluetooth 700GB I can view the 3D photos on my LG Smart TV, Cinema 3D, via the camera. BUT I would like to edit and view my films/photos on my laptop first before I view on the TV. I look forward to your reply Thank you, Jonet Ford

Ladies and gentlemen, by the patch on Pinnacle 17.0.1 the program is running stable. Nevertheless, the program hangs when "Edit" mode when you open a new tab media and navigating want to select the contents of the new tab. If one waits to take place close the program, it takes between 2 and 5 minutes until it responds again.All other programs run alongside any problems, only Pinnacle stands. On the computing power it is not, NemoCheck reports a perfect system (Intel Core i7-720QM, 8 GB RAM, ATI Mobility Radeon HD 5850 with 1 GB memory). Please help. Best regards Oliver Heuser

I recently switched to Pinnacle Ultimate V17 and had promised improvements in RedGiant graphics tools !!! All is well so far with V17. However, the RedGiant functions Trapcode Particular not work for me. Once I egale the Particular transitions that select them, that processing of the video is totally impossible. Each save the project, then lasts 10-20Minutes. I Expand to 1 photo / video it takes again 10-20 minutes before further processing of the project is possible. Sometimes the system crashes then also from total. In the Timeline emerges in the transitional photo after some time a red rectangle with an exclamation point on. Knoll Light Factory works z.B.einwandfrei. Only the Trapcode Particular function is totally disrupted!!!! But these features are too good to pass up !!! V16 in the version I had these problems alike. Unfortunately, this has not been resolved with the V17! If a problem solution is not possible, I hereby would like to update the version back to version V17 and request a reversal of my order !!! I expect now as soon as possible a solution. MFG Norbert Stoltenberg

Even after having registered this product on your website again, I get no e-mail support code. However, a Customer Care ID: 10135091 but I can on the support page nothing with it. I have absolutely technicalsupport needed, as I sit with an unworkable product at this time (see further). 2. Pinnacle is unworkable (slow?) I want to put this question to the technical support, but it lacks me inexplicably a necessary support code? The product installation went smoothly, but the use is impossible because the product after each click tens of minutes (Inot exaggerating) needs to show. next screen Windows reports, "NGStudio not responding" in task manager but is still 30% CPU etc. consumed. It is an Intel i7 quad-core computer and you supplied Nemo Check also reports that my system is fast. Further technical details are available.

Since Studio 16 Ultimate I had no access to the extra included content, so by buying Studio 17 Ultimate I thought that would correct that problem, but NO , I still have no access to the extra content ie:Creative Pack Vol 1, Title Extreme, etc. Another problem: I never received the Support code, I only receive the email confirmation of my Registration. It is frustrating no having a contact number tosolve this type of problems, I have wasted two days to be able to ask for help, until today I was able to select Studio 17 under the product selection for help. Studio 17 Ultimate was installed and Studio 16 Ultimate was kept as well. so I have two versions with no access to the free included content. Please, help me out. Thanks

When starting the program, the message "NGStudio has stopped working" and the program can only close. As I could see the online forums, the problem of program crash seems to occur at many customers. Ineed the program urgently and have not got time for days waiting for support. Therefore, I would like to cancel the purchase of the software, and please consult transfer. The time required I observed and the lack on the day of purchase displays.

Dear Sirs, I recently signed up for the update listed below (download version) and decided this purchased from pinnacle_estore.de.cs@digitalriver.com. Previously I was using Pinnacle Studi 16 Ultimate and therefore was looking forward to the new version. Unfortunately, the joy was abruptly stopped because the new version does not install. It is regularlythe error message "Pinnacle Studio 17 Installer Information - database: The Launch Condition table could not be loaded in the SQL query: SELECT Condition, Description FROM leek Condition." With this message I can not do anything. Also re-download the software did not bring the desired success. Waiting for your reply / help. Best regards Olaf Fischer

After no burning of BR was possible with Studio 16, the program or in the creation of the BR still crashed, I must say now that nothing works after installing Studio 17. The video files are not playable (although was generated with a 16 disc). The program crashes when gerinsten occasion. The computer has been specially ubgedatet on Windows 8.1 (before installingby Studio 17) all old Progranmmversionen (15,16) are deleted. If the program then but after minutes driving times completely up are all imported video files in red and with! provided. All files that were easily edited with S16. The Event Log is a reference to an unsupported size or file type. In conclusion, I can only say that I last in theYears with Studio 14 - 17 have experienced a lot, but really the skin of the drum from the floor. After a Studio 16 never works properly now has 17 for sale that did not work. All Wartungsafgaben the operating system are done and say only from the computer therefore has no fault.

So I have not been able to get this last file. Now I have used up my 5 times and digitalrivers says I can't try to download anymore. I want this last file that I paid for! Please reset everything or send me the disks. I sent a messageyesterday/ 31 oct...about this problem; but never got a response back...kinda bad customer service so far....

I cannot get studio 17 to open. I receive multiple errors. The watch list finds multiple files it cannot open. The NG Studio has stopped working. My PC runs very slow as studio tries to open as it all my resources are being sucked into studio. This is a terrible experience. Also I do not see where to confirm what premium content is available. I had content that I purchased for previous versions that I want to insure has been loaded. Not a happy customer with this new version...

Pinnacle Studio 17 Ultimate will not startup after installation in Windows 8.1. I tried a number of troubleshooting attempts with no luck. I noticed Pinnacle Studio 16 had some fixes but wasn't sure if it would work on the Pinnacle Studio 17 Ultimate. I did have the Pinnacle Studio 16 Ultimate installed on the computer and it also wouldn't start up and that's why upgraded to 17. When I had problems with 17 I uninstalled 16 to see if that would have fixed the issue. No luck.

The download seemed to go well, but when I clicked on the desktop icon to finish the installation, it gets to the point where the InstallShield Wizard for Pinnacle Studio 17 comes up, and as soon as the Wizard pops up its "Welcome" window, an error box titled "Pinnacle Studio 17 - Standard Content Pack Installer..." shows up saying "Error 2343.Specified path is empty" in the box. We have tried manytimes to get it to work, but it constantly pops up with the error message, and once we hit "Ok", the next window is "InstallShield Wizard completed", but it says, "The wizard was interrupted before Pinnacle Studio 17 - Standard Content Pack could be completely installed. Your system has not been modified. To complete installation at another time, please run setup again. Click Finish to exit the wizard."We are not sure how to fix this so we can completely and safely install Pinnacle Studio 17 so I can finally edit my videos.

I am using Pinnacle Studio as of version 7 up to version 15 Always with great pleasure. Then when v. 16 came out with less pleasure as it was based on Avid Studio which I also purchased and also did not like very much. So I immeadiately purchased Pinnacle v. 17 as I hoped it was 64bit but was disappointed when it installed as 32bit. Now this version is very disappointing. Titles do not work, menusdo not work and the program stops very frequently. Also the speed (v. 16) does not work correct. I am using v. 15 to make proper slow motion movies. What can be the reason?

Hello, about every 10 minutes, my Pinnacle Studio 17 software crash with the following error: "NG Studio has stopped working." It does not seem to be any action related to this crash, but it is routine after ten minutes of use. Moreover, the effect is speed bugger the project and it is impossible to look at the record of an accelerated sequence. I had the same worrieswith Studio 16, and I upgraded hoping it would solve the problems, but this is not the case. I've updated all my drivers and my version of Windows, I did a defrag, have uninstalled and reinstalled Studio ... What should I do? Thank you for your help, Sandie Cabrol 0044 79 38607381

I just purchased Pinnacle 17 Ultimate via on line and I have to receive my support code despite that I have already registered the product. Currently I'm facing some issues with Pinnacle 17 and I need immediate support. Pls advice. Without the code i can't send in my questionnaires to your support group. Apparently, when I do a edit cut for my AVCHD contents, it will takes approx 5 to 10 sec beforeit can continue to play whenever i try to review. My PC specification is Intel Core i7-4770 CPU@3.40Ghz. Running on 64 bit Windows 8.1. My Ram is 24GB. My Graphic Card is Nvidia Geforce GT 640. I pretty sure there is a bug that need to be fixed. Therefore, mind to release the Patch ASAP as I just purchased less then 4 hours ago. I have many videos need to edit as I have just upgrade from Avid Studio.

I cannot get the installation program to install properly. Once I have run the setup program, the InstallManager startup fails! I tried to work around that by running InstallManager directly. It managed to register me, and then start the installation program. However, the first step of that is an update of DirectX, which does not work. I cannot continue, and I am very frustrated.

I have just downloaded Pinnacle Ultimate 17. There are numerous problems with the installation process. Firstly, when I start the SETUP program, and after it unzips the installation files, I get an error when the program tries to access the In. As a workaround, I went to the Install Manager folder and ran the Setup program. It registers my activation code, then starts the Installation dialog, I choseSTANDARD INSTALLATION. Then, it informs me that DirectX must be update, at which point it tries to open file called "Mark" with no extension. That's where the install fails.

When I press the title icon I receive this message: default title wasn't found in the installed content. Title editor can't be opened. (2) when I drag and drop transitions they do not work.(3) I keep getting this message: NG studio not responding do you want to wait until it responds or closethe programme? Everything else appears to be working fine. Do you think that there is a problem with the doownloaded content?

Problems with activating my product please Where is my support code for my purchase today? Where on earth do I find the online question form? I would probably not need anything if you would provide a better service for the money. Sorry, but I'm after the hours of fruitless searching and trying easily annoyed. For 10 years, I usePinnacle products (always a good boy registered), am now on the verge to annoy me to have bought today again. When installing Studio 17setup.exe access is denied me, because the Pinnacle Studio application is missing. I do not know what the bedeudet, nor how I should take. I bought 16 Ultimate only 14 days before the studio, everything was still good. For hoursI sit in front of the computer and find no answer.

By mistake I inserted a drive D: (with over 100.000 of photos') as map to be considered by the library tool. When I access the Library function it takes hours after each click before Studio reacts... I was able to remove drive D: from the settings pannel... however, due to the bad response times and probably a wrongly placed click with the mouse, the drive is no longer scanned, but the items are stillin the library... difficult to remove just due to the bad response times ... Is ther nay way to re-initiliase Studio so that he will build up the library again from scratch from the new settings ? I have tried once deleting the NGdatabase folder in order to have Studio to build the database again, but that does not seem to be the only thing to do to have proper reinitialisation ....

I went to C: - program files - pinnacle - and the folder was there with the folder of the Studio 11. I triedto reinstall and a window appeared asking me to remove or repair the installation. I tried everything. When I open the studio icon, the Studio 11 appears, but after the installation any icon, or something like that from Studio 17 appeared. Please, can you help me to fix it?

I can't even work on a project because each time I click to a photo or video it just processes and processes with the windows circle taking its' time. It's ridiculous! I have a very fast machine with plenty of ram and hard drive space. (1TB of space, 16gb ram, and I7 processor)I have Pinnacle 16, which operates just fine, with no lag, delay, etc. but it's impossible to work on anything with the constant delay in just going from one photo to another.

Thanks for all previous Pinnacle Studio versions (since no. 7)? I love the program! It is terrific to be able to implement your own creativity with his help! Therefore, it was no question for me to make the upgrade to version 17. And I'm assuming this is not to regret ... - although I unfortunately did not inspire the first steps of:? (1) On my system running MicrosoftWindows 7 Home Premium 64-bit SP1 - CPU = Intel Core i5 3450 @ 3.10GHz - RAM 8 GB DDR3 @ 500 MHz NVIDIA GeForce GT 630. Daher hatte ich erwartet, dass die 64bit-Version installiert wird. Angeboten wurde jedoch "Programme (x86)"ran with 50 ... 75% for "NGStudoi 32 *" - after very great patience and many minutes was sometime the work surface can be used - and the next crash followed! Résumé: In addition to crash the program does not really! I hope this bug can be fixed in a timely manner, so that a really solid work is at all possible !!! PS: also version 16 crashes occasionally from - but then thanks to the fast PC in less than a minute to start again (especially in the Effect Editor or title.)!

Hi Tech Guys, Pinnacle Studio 14 has made a right royal mess inside of my machine ... I need to know if I am going to have to rebuild my machine prior to installing Pinnacle Studio 17 to avoid the same corruption into 17 and even more corruption throughout my laptop ... I have had several discussions with Sales - originally I was told that upgrading to 17 would 'fix' my problems with 14, then I wastold that they are individual programmes, so 17 was neither an 'upgrade' nor a 'fix' to 14 ... This leaves me with a problem as 14 will not remove itself from my machine and has left several corrupted files and registry keys on my machine ... I'm pretty sure I need a way to get rid of them ... If rebuilding my machine is the only way that isn't a good thing, I would really rather not have to do that... Hopefully you guys have a nifty trick you can tell me about so that I can install 17 and also please advise as to HOW to install 17 - I got sent the 3 electronic .exe files but I do not know what order to install them in, and am not willing to go installing them just yet as I do not know what it will do to my computer, if I install that, then use a template I made in 14, is the corruption goingto import into 17 as well? Sales told me that they would make notes of these questions and to make the 'service request' number encompass them, I do not know if they actually have though (Elaine was lovely though, she was my contact while trying to get this fixed as I couldn't get through to yourselves, despite assurances from the Canadian team that they had raised Service requests with you, Elainetold me that none were actually listed) . I hope you can help.. I can be contacted on 07 3201 4286 or 0407 420 578 Thank you very much Kind regards Alicia Hollywood 07 3201 4286 0407 420 578

I have bought Pinnacle Studio Ultimate Upgrade this week on the net when I saw your upgrade notice. As a resulty I lost money and my existing Studio 16 Ultimate is paralyzed and I have nothing to show for it. Please read my story? This is my system specification: Windows 7 Professional 2009 Service Pack 1 Processor: Intel Core i% CPU 650@3.20GHz Installed memory(RAM): 16.0GB System type: 64-bit Operatingsystem NVIDIA GeForce GTX650 Direct3D API version: 11 Direct3D feature level 11_0 CUDA Cores: 384 Shared System Memory: 2048 MB I am a regular user of Pinnacle Studio Ultimate16 and I use it to create video for Youtube from which I earn my income. I am busy developing that further. When Pinnacle Studio arrived I decided to take immediate advantage of it because I was hoping to get a more stable productas the constant NGStudio crashes of Pinnacle Studio Ultimate 16 was beginning te get annoying. Also, the fact that Pinnacle Studio Ultimate 17 promised to have up to 10 times faster rendering was very attractive as I had real difficulty with the long periods that my program got tied up during file export when I could do no editing. So I went to the shop, registered a new email address and password(as I got a new email address recently) and bought the package and downloaded the following three files: Studio_17_Content.exe PinnacleStudio17_Setup.exe Ultimate_Bonus_Content.exe I then tried to install them in the sequence that they are above. The Studio_17_Content.exe went smoothly. So far so good. Then I tried to install the file PinnacleStudio17_Setup.exe. It extracted the files to the installerdirectory and it allowed me to choose my language. When I clicked I got the following message in a window called "Studio Installer:" Could not start C:\Program Files(x86)\Pinnacle\InstallManager\Studio17\InstallManager.exe While this window is open another one with the name "Pinnacle Studio" is running as well which tells me to wait "We are preparing your system to install Pinnacle Studio. Please Wait...."I can wait forever, nothing else is ever going to happen. So if I click O.K. on the "Studio Installer" window it closes and so does the other one. End of story. So now I have tried to be clever and I went to my Desktop folder where the directory that was just extracted "PinnacleStudioSetup" resides. If I execute "C:......\Desktop\PinnacleStudioSetup\WelcomeNG\Welcome.exe", the same thing happens justas I described it now. If I rather click "Setup.exe" in the root here, I get a reaction. But that relates to the content pack so I can't use it. So I go to the Installmanager directory and click "Installmanager.exe" and a appropriate window appears that wish me welcome and promises me to install Pinnacle Studio 17 Ultimate. (This is an upgrade from Pinnacle Studio Ultimate 16). After a short periodI get a notice window that tells me that Installshield wizard has successfully installed the Pinnacle Studio 17 - Install Manager. When I click this down I get a new window that pops up and this is the Install Manager that comes into working. It offers me the options of "Standard Installation" or "Custom Installation." If I look at custom it seems most packages are present already and marked in greentick where the "Pinnacle Studio Application" has a grey tick which supposedly suggest that that would be the package that will now be installed. I click "Install" It is here where I have trouble again. A window pops up that asks me "Choose the program you want to use to open this file:" I get many options of different readers. In the meantime, the Install mananger window indicates "Installation inprogress" but it appears that nothing much happens. So I decide to choose Notepad and a file with the name "Seths.txt" (which may have been a file I stored before but I am not too sure) opens with the following content: =========================================================================== Interface List 11...90 e6 ba c8 f6 ce ......Realtek PCIe GBE Family Controller 1...........................SoftwareLoopback Interface 1 ... 12 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 E0 14 Customizing Microsoft ISATAP ... 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 E0 Teredo tunneling Pseudo-Interface =============== ================================================== ========== Jump the timing That I do the selection of this file, the sound and the window with the name "Exception!" Appears and IT states "C: \ Program Fles (x86) \ Pinnacle \ Studio 17 \ Programs \ NGStudio.exe"The Install Manager is still running and it now states: "Setup is optimizing your installation of Studio. This will take just a moment." As soon as I click down the exception window, the installmanager shuts down. So my third attempt is now ro go the folder "C:\Users\....\Desktop\PinnacleStudioSetup\Studio" and to click "setup.exe" in that folder. It asked my register and activate and yes I did sosuccessfully with the serial number and my latest email address, the same one I used when I bought and paid for the product. It replied with the "Thank you for registering" and the whole story there. I accept the license agreement. I install to the default directories. After a while the Installshield wizard reports successful completion. The Pinnacle Studio 17 icon on my desktop is now visible andI click on it to open it. It is immediately clear that no Effects, Transitions, Sound Effects, Montage, Soundstage, Titles or Disc Menus are visible on the grey screen of "Organize" where I used to remember them from Studio 16. Also none of the photos and videos of Studio 16 are visible anymore. It is like a bare slate. I go to setup and set up a watch folder where my videos and photos are. It startsupdating them. But they never appear. When I try to open any of my Studio 16 projects it gives me a message: "Error Opening Document" and "A new project will be created." So, lets try Studio 16, I have a lot of projects to finish and can't afford this nonsense..But no, Studio 16 is now also in this state, there is nothing left of it. Not working. So, maybe there was a fault in that file, I have paidfor extended downloads so I should be able to go there anytime to do so, isn't it? But no, the "Sign in to corel.com to access your Pinnacle order history" window tells me very friendly that the email that I used when I bought the project does not exist on the system although I have clearly received an email on that address with my activation keys. I begin to wonder about this company and what theyare up to. I have effectively bought myself paralysis to my software that was working and I have no improvement as anticipated. I hope this description is detailed enough?

Case 01911580 - ref:_00D60Jqva._50060UW7r9:ref Dear Sir, I have done as you suggest  (It is possible to uninstall Studio 16 and Studio 17. Then Reboot your computer and Install the Studio 17 only. So we can Identify what causing the issue.) but to no avail. In fact things are worse than ever! The program loads but when I load the file that I have been working on only half of the scenes show as open,the remainder show a picture but will not run! Furthermore the time line just shows question marks. In past versions this would have prompted a box opening asking me to re-link the scenes, this is not happening now. I have tried using Import on the relevant folder. It goes through the import process of the scenes but the result is a page full of question marks and going back to the Library there is no change. I look forward to a positive reply quickly!

I just purchased Pinnacle Studio 17 online. The download won't run. there is an error code 2343: Specified path is empty. So therefore I can't register or get a code. I did NOT receive an email after ordering either. If I can't download I want my money back. I also ordered EDS. My new computer crashed, Dell sent me a new one. My old pinnacle 16 ultimate is gone. It hasn't even been a year since I purchasedit, and no one at Pinnacle technical support will help me download it to my new computer .I thought it would be easier to just purchase an upgrade. Of course I was wrong. So upset with Pinnacle. Good product- LOUSY CUSTOMER SERVICE! My Order Number: 8865778737

New problem: The installation of PinnacleStudio 17 per Setup.exe sees during installation ok, ie it all comes from in German. But when I open the program after installation, everything appears in "English". How do I get out that the program is working on "German", as IAnyway Pinnacle was used? The setup program tells me that I should have installed everything -?. To "German", no chance to change the language) The additional program (iZotope Music ... turn runs flawlessly on "German" greeting from Manfred Knopke addition, always appears the message (in English) that I had already registered my registered program NOT ?? !!!

I cannot install because I receive the following error message during setup:error 2343, specific path is empty.

Hi, I had been emailing back and forth with Larry but haven't heard back in a little while. My problem basically boils down to this: * I bought Studio 12 a few years ago. * I bought the downloadable upgrade to Studio 12 Ultimate a couple of years ago. * My computer had to be reformatted. * I bought and downloaded Studio 17 two days ago, but I can't use it on my computer - it's too much for my systemto handle, and it is a completely new interface --- far too advanced for my basic stuff. * I would like to return Studio 17 and go back to studio 12 Ultimate. * I have reinstalled regular Studio 12 but when I tried to install the upgrade that I paid for, it says it needs to be re-downloaded to work. * The link to download my Studio 12 Ultimate upgrade from a couple of years ago no longer exists. *When I went into Corel to re-download it as a past purchase, it could not find it. * PLEASE HELP. I just want to be able to re-download my Studio 12 Ultimate. Thanks. Josh Brandon (310) 967 9680

I downloaded and ran all 3 installation files for Studio 17 Ultimate, and ran all 3, apparently successfully. However, in the asset list on the left of the screen, all I can see of the HFX volumes is HFX Vol 1 - Multimedia 1. I have tried re-installing several times, but to no avail. Where are volumes 2 and 3, and the rest of Volume 1? Have I done something wrong?

Hi. Have had Pinnacle products from Studio 9 to 15 then to Avid Studio and now I bought the upgrade to Pinnacle Ultimate 17. I have struggled with the change in your company and the unfriendly support process you have to get any joy to even ask you for support and I have found it very frustrating and question why I have been this loyal? My latest issue is that I do not have the default content in myPinnacle 17 Ultimate upgrade, despite downloading it a number of times due to your unstable downloads. I have run the repait but have found no issues. I ahve also found that content from previous versions are not automatically there and I have to re-download them instead of having the opportunity to load serial numbers. Please can you help as I really love your product. Serial : JBUAO-ABBAA-BFHFF-FEAAC-XZSOCPassport: 00093-91504-89400-05782-68988 I have other serials for 9, 12, 14 and 15 as well as the Avid Studio as well as the codes for Sonic fire, etc. I look forward to hearing from you shortly. Thank you

I am having trouble with this product coming up with error codes just like your Version 12 did on my old computer. I purposely purchased a new laptop with a Core 7 2.2 ghz processor, 8 GB memory, 1 tb hard drive, 2 gb video and windows 8.1 and also purchased your new version 17 Ultimate and still having issues with your program! I am realizing that your product is second best and I should search fora better one. I have spent a lot of money just for this program and I am very upset! I should have known by how you only give free support for 14 days!! Most companies give support for a year or even longer because they know and trust their product. Oh and yes I did download and install the patch for this program. I WANT THIS FIXED OR I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!!

I hope you have a solution to my problem, otherwise I promise you to go to every single social media available to let know what a letdown Pinnacle 17 is! I have just installed the new update thinking that will make a difference but it didnt. The program is so unstable that you click in any media, any command and it takes, as an average, from four to six minutes to actually do what is request. I thought,could be my computer (that by the way, Pinnacle 11 and Avid Studio, my previous versions work fine) so I clean, re-clean, erase all the previous Pinnacle software and reinstalled Pinnacle 17. Nope, the same problem, my computer system is: AMD Phenom II X4 810 Processor 2.60 GHz Ram: 8.00 GB Windows 7, On a 64-bit Operation NVIDIA GeForce GT 430 Video Card 699 GB of Hard Disk I believe, it should beenough to have the program running properly and not struggling on every single step.

I installed an update studio 17 ultimate because I already own studio 16 ultimate. I installed the 17 version in a different folder 16 in order to keep the two versions, but I did point the working files to the same locations for both versions. However, both versions worked version 17 often crash. So I decided to uninstalltwo version recover only version 17. I have 17 without reinstalling the software asks me for a key against I only have the home page and menu items are inaccessible. Suspecting a problem with the registry with regedit so I deleted all the keys "pinnacle" and "avid". Reinstall the product without asking key but still homepage menu with unreachable(Again, config, etc ... I click and nothing happens ..). How to reinstall the product itself? and above all completely uninstall the old one. Thank you for your help.

I have a few questions about problems wiht the new install. I just update to Pinnacle latest patch 17.0.1 it did not fix these problems. 1. When I hit export program crashes, I have tried running as administrator, this does not make it work. 2. Program is very slow, when I bring in a video to the track line it might take like 3 minutes before I can work with it. When I do work with video everythingI do is slow, like if I hit pause it stops like 20 seconds later. If I hit play it plays like 20 seconds later I have a new computer running Gen 4 I-7 with Intel 4400 video graphics. 8mb ram, 512 solid state drive. Updated video drivers.

Hi, I updated my pc to win 8.1 a few weeks ago - pc runs flawlessly, 32 bit machine. But, after that I couldn't run my Studio 14. So I purchased online Studio 17 Plus. Downloaded the 3 files - OK. A bit problematic to install, as it did not run automatically, but I found an installation file in the Studio folder. Installation proces then started OK, through registration and so forth, but in the endit stopped, saying: Can't install Error 1327. Invalid Drive: E:\ I do not have a drive E. Also, intalling 17.0.1 patch couldn't be done - "installation program not found". What to do? Thanks, Steen

When attempting to start the program it either sits with Win 7 equivalent of a spinning hourglass or has a message that the NGS Studio program has stopped working at which point the only option is to close the program. This has happened since the first install but the problem has become worse. My initial purchase was a download with backup disk. After the disk arrived I removed the program and reloadedfrom the disk and it worked briefly. Today I went to the support site and downloaded the patch that is supposed to improve stability. I now can't do anything I tried to determine the version to verify that the patch was installed. When can we expect a working version of Studio 17?

I have had major problems with this products. At first I could not get it to download properly. When I ordered this product I also ordered a disc. I waited for the disc to arrive and when it did I tried to install 17 from the disc. But during download , install stopped and a message came up, Can not continue FILES ARE CORRUPTED!!!! At this time I called and got the information to download again fromthe internet. Download was a success. I then installed 17 Ultimate on my computer. Now comes the worst part of the time consuming nightmare. After installing the program and try to bring it up on my computer the program take for ever to load 5 to 10 Minutes. after it loads and I try to use it but the programs continually hangs up with a message that NGS has stopped running and I can either wait forit to start or close the program. Also, If I try to go from one are to another it takes for ever to complete this task. I have purchase several Corel, Pinnacle and Roxio products and never have I had such time consuming problems.

Hello, My name is Eric McGill. I recently purchased an upgrade from Pinnacle studio 15 Ultimate to Pinnacle Studio 17. I am very unsatisfied with the new software because there are crucial editing tools that appear to be missing. In Pinnacle Studio 15, there were basic edting tools called special effects. These basic tools included effects such as witness protection, old film, spot light, green screen,pan and zoom. Additionally, I have no transitions to choose from. I think that there may be a possibility that the down load or update was corrupted? RedGiant does not offer any of these basic (but very essential) editing tools. Techniques such as slow motion and spot light are exactly the tools that I need. Please offer me a solution as soon as humanly possible. If necessary, please allow me to downloadthe "full" version of Pinnacle Studio 17 Ultimate. If the problem persists, then I'll have no choice but to cancel my order for a refund. I think that if I delete/remove all Pinnacle software from my computer, then I may have a better chance of getting a downlaod that is complete and not corrupted or incomplete. That is of course (unless) these basic editing tools that I require are no longer a partof Pinnacle Studio 17 Ultimate. If that is the case, then I will be requesting a refund and will purchase another video editing software. In order to save time, please send me the link and activation key for the full version of the Pinnacle Studio 17 Ultimate software. I need this resolved as soon as possible. Please feel free to contact me by phone at 330-734-8934. Thank you for your time and assistance regarding this matter. Repsectfully, Eric McGill.

The spare disk is probably corrupt files because the disk is severely damaged when packing and transport.

To remind you, these are the faults. They are NOT cured by the recent update. Case Number 01908762 Try to run Studio 17 but all that happens is that the Organise screen appears and the cursor rotates constantly. After waiting for 20 minutes it stops and looks as if it has loaded ok. However when I go to the edit screen the cursorrotates again but never stops. Instead the error message appears informing me that it has crashed! I have re-booted and tried again with the same result. You advertise that this version is faster than previous versions!!

To date, apart from an automatedreply, I have not received a reply. Please do so. To elaborate - The program takes ages to load and when it finally does using it is impossible for the following reasons. a) Organise. It displays as missing media items that were removed from the computer BEFORE Studio 17 was installed. They are not in Studio 16's files! b) Trying to delete the foregoing is impossible. Each frame takes up to 20 minutesto be deleted! c) Checking background services shows that NGStudio.exe is not responding. d) Trying to Edit is impossible. Every time I move a frame I have to wait 4-5 minutes for a response. e) In Edit if I try to go to another library then I might as well go to the pub for a hour!! My computer is more than adequate to run this program. It runs Studio 16 without a hitch. If I do not receive an fixfor this programming fault by 6th November 2013 then I will require a refund under the distance trading legislation. Your Personal Identification Number (PIN) is: 156007807 Case Number 01913702 Case 01911580 - ref:_00D60Jqva._50060UW7r9:ref Dear Sir, I have done as you suggest ? (It is possible to uninstall Studio 16 and Studio 17. Then Reboot your computer and Install the Studio 17 only. So we canIdentify what causing the issue.) but to no avail. In fact things are worse than ever! The program loads but when I load the file that I have been working on only half of the scenes show as open, the remainder show a picture but will not run! Furthermore the time line just shows question marks. In past versions this would have prompted a box opening asking me to re-link the scenes, this is not happeningnow. I have tried using ?Import? on the relevant folder. It goes through the import process of the scenes but the result is a page full of question marks and going back to the ?Library? there is no change. I look forward to a positive reply quickly! Shopper Email: ken.marston@talktalk.net Shopper Comments: I have just downloaded and installed Studio17. However it has major faults. It takes up to 20minutes to load and then is so slow as to be unusable. After another 10 minutes I managed to load the file that I had been working on with Studio 16 but then had to wait a further 10 minutes for it to locate a frame in the media file!! Even then it only presented me with the folder and not the frame. My computer is more than capable of running this type of program and. as stated, had no problems withStudio 16. Have you a fix available for this fault? If not I will have a refund . If an associated requisition exists, the following fields were completed. Order Number: 15262732628 Order Date: 31 October 2013 Site ID: piestore Please note the highlighted sentence. I look forward to a solution to this fault BY RETURN or I will have a refund.

I then downloaded a complete Studio 17 Ultimate programme and this often crashes or refuses to load correctly, although I did manage to import some video from my camcorder it only imported audio versions.

After downloading Pinnacle Studio 17 Ultimate several times, the install program will not finish without a 'Error 1311 Source file not found:...\Data1.cab. Also I have submitted (2) cases on 11-12-13 regarding this problem and apparently my registration didn't work since I did not have a 'Support Code' I now have a new support code. Do I need to acquire the 'installation CD' in order to install Studio 17 Ultimate?

I purchased and downloaded the product. However I have not a reason to use the programme until today, and when it opened, it said there was an update, which I then started to download. But this stopped part way, when it said that there was a file missing. I then tried to run the programme again and this time it said "The Operating System has been upgraded after Studio has been installed. Some or allof the programs features may not operate correctly. We recommend that you re-install the software". I believe there was an automatic Microsoft update a few days ago, which may be related. However I do not have the files to download once again, and I cannot find on your websites where I am to find them - its a nightmare. I assume I need to uninstall all the programme and reinstall. but how on earth do I do it. Some help please.

I have already registered Pinnacle 17 Ultimate, and received a Customer Care ID of 14096482, which does not work as a Support Code. I have scoured the Pinnacle website and have found no assistance at all for my problem. When I run my copy of Pinnacle 17 Ultimate, I cannot find any of the Ultimate Bonus Content, or any "add-on" content whatsoever. I had previously purchased both Pinnacle Studio 14 andAvid Studio, so I am familiar with some of the add-ons. Please help! This is much more frustrating than it should be!!

Although 16 was a little slow, at least it worked. I am very disappointed and regret purchasing Studio 17 Ultimate. I am on a very high end factory HP (not home built), 8 cpu's and 16gb of ram on a 750gb SSD with 2Tb auxiliary Win 7 Pro 64. I have applied both updates to no avail. As soon as i try a chroma key it hangs (hourglass), never comes back. Audio edit, hangs (hourglass) never comes back. Ihave wasted many hours following all the knowledge base suggestions (most for NgStudio are outdated and irrelevant). At this point I want to give up on Pinnacle. Sad because I had high hopes for it. If you are going to give me some boiler plate response like 'uninstall and reinstall' then please direct my ticket to billing and I want to request an immediate refund. Regards, B Nevans

I downloaded all 3 files from my purcahse late last night. I worked all night and EARLY this morning I tried to start the installation process but am unable to install the very 1st file [Studio_17_Content.exe] as it gives me an error message that says this file is not a valid WIN32 application. My computer is using WIN 7 / 64 bit and I have the WIN32 enabled and have never had any problems with installationbefore for Corel, Pinnacle or anything else. I called EARLY this morning and the agent took my serial number to register the product so I could get help and told me to expect an E-mail within a few hours giving me a support code and instructions to get help. That was EIGHT hours ago and NO E-mail has arrived. I am ready to forget the whole thing and get a full refund. There is no reason for a brandnew version to not install correctly right away. I currently have version 16 installed on my computer. I just went online and registered the product as it appears your agent never did really register it fo me. AND I have just gotten an E-mail confirming that as well as a link to get support - which I am now doing> After being up all night IO would really like to complete the installation and go to bed.

I launch Studio 17 Ultimate (Windows 7, 64 bit professional). It launches OK, BUT it hangs when it looks like it is automatically importing my media from the hard drive. I've waited for minutes but the Windows task manager tells me that the programme has become unresponsive. Even if I wait, nothing happens. I ultimately have to close the application from the task manager. This is very irritating asI did NOT expect this to happen after paying for the product. Do you have any suggestions on how I can actually get into Pinnacle Studio and actually use the programme? Thanks, Paul

I rebooted my PC (which has an i7 processor and 8gb ram) and re-tried export several times, always with the same result. Finally I had to use Studio 16 to export the project. Is the fact that I did not uninstall Studio 16 interfering with thwworking of Studio 17? The FAQ however states that uninstalling a previous version is optional. So why is Studio 17 crashing when I pree the 'export' button?

I recently purchased Pinnacle Studio 17 Ultimate to replace Studio Ultimate 16 (the latter software is still operational on my PC) which in turn replaced Avid (which is uninstalled now) under Windows 7. When I try to export a video, the screen "Studio Exporter" has the following settings: Export type = Disc Settings: type = DVD Preset = Best quality Destination device = (BD-RE 25 GB) Target size isset to "unlimited" (25 GB doesnot show in dropdownlist). When I change "Settings type" to Blu-ray disc I receive the message (in Dutch) "NGStudio doesn't work anymore. The program will be terminated." and Pinnacle Studio is closed. I read in your database about Export errors and four methods to correct it. Ad 1 and 2: I can't find Video and Audio preferences (Set up only shows "control panel", whichin turn only deals with Watchfolders). Ad method 3: When I browse to c:/ProgramData there is no map Studioxx./Data. Ad method 4: the five steps did not lead to a successful export to a blu-ray disc. How can I solve this problem?

First, for every action I try to initiate the response time may take 1-2 minutes or more. The wheel just keeps turning. NGStudio stops responding and I have to close and reopen Pinnacle....repeatedly. This of course is very annoying and time consuming. Do I leave the Studio 16 folder in the program files or should the entire 16 version be deleted? Also, though Windows 8 is the OS the Windows compatibilitymode is Windows XP (service pack 3). Is that correct I see options to change compatibility to Windows 7, Vista SP2, and XP3 but no W8 compatibility option. I like the program but I don't want to pay for an upgrade and deal with more problem than I had in the 16 version.

The application is useless without the ability to export. Thanks

I have over 42tb of mostly pictures and videos. When I added these folders to Studio to "watch", the program became so busy loading in the thumbnails (or whatever is does) is has become unusable. The Pinnacle KB has no info on how to remove these "watched" folders. Its locked-up and I cannot change (remove) them. I have uninstalled everything and scanned the system folders and the Win 8 registry andcannot find where these "watched" folders I have selected are stored. Even after uninstalling and re-installing, Studio is "remembering" the "Watched" folders. I cannot find any Pinnacle utility to clean-up after uninstall to force the product back to all of its defaults. I want the "watched" folders to revert to their original default paths and I cannot do that with Studio running because it is notyielding enough to the OS for me to make these changes through the UI. The TaskMGR says its "Not Running" but I know it is. Its just trying to load all of my photos and videos. I should have never defined these folders because 42tb is a lot of data. If I let Studio run as it is alone for a few weeks, it may finish and I can remove these "watched" folders. I just don't have two weeks to dedicate to this program. Jack.

I contact you on 31/10/13 regarding thr program not responding. To date, apart form an automated reply, I have not received a reply. Please do so. To elaborate - The program takes ages to load and when it finaly does using it is impossible for the following reasons. a) Organise. It displays as missing media items that were removed from the computer BEFORE Studio 17 was installed. They are not in Studio16's files! b) Trying to delete the foregoing is imossible. Each frame takes upto 20 minutes to be deleted! c) Checking background services shows that NGStudio.exe is not responding. d) Trying to Edit is impossible. Every time I move a frame I have to wait 4-5 minutes for a reponce. e) In Edit if I try to go to another library then I might as well go to the pub for a hour!! My computer is more thanadequate to run this program. It runs Studio 16 without a hitch. If I do not receive an fix for this programming fault by 6th November 2013 then I will require a refund under the distance trading legislation.

However, video previews (both in the movie project tab and organize tab) doesn't work that well. Most of the time I get black screen, while I can hear the audio. Tried all the troubleshooting on the knowledge base. Win 7, Second gen i7 2600k, 16GB memory, intel HD 2000graphics. I have PS 12 ultimate and Avid Studio on the same system. PS 12 works well.

Ladies and gentlemen, I hope you can help me. I've been using for years, Pinnacle Studio, Avid Studio 1.0 then, now Pinnacle Studio 17 Ultimate. In the old Pinnacle versions I could also display small photos in a video and set the position of the small picture. I have this function already desperately in Avid Studio 1.0 and now desperately in Pinnacle Studio 17wanted. I just get out any additional, small screen display, wherein the video in the background runs. I can place an image and place it over the video. When playing the video will not show up in the background, it is all black around the image. What functions should I use? Then another problem, which I do not manage it today. I would like toa photo run as a still image 5 seconds, then to a place inside-back and then again display 5 seconds in the enlarged section. It used to be used to image three times. The first photo I can see a still image 5 seconds. Then zoomed in the second, same photo to a location inside. The third picture after inserting the previous zoom-siterecognized and I was able to display the same, third picture in this position again zoomed longer. Since Avid Studio this does not work anymore. You can display an image for longer, then add the same image and a point-in back. After zooming, but I do not get it out that the picture freezes again a few seconds to the enlarged body at restTo watch. The third picture attached earlier today no longer recognizes the zoom magnification of the previous image. How can I transfer previously used effects on the next picture (in my case, the zoom function)? The user of Avid Studio is two problems to find anything for Studio 17 and there is no German user. For help I would be very grateful and remain with best regards Oliver Heuser

Ladies and gentlemen, some time ago I had Pinnacle Studio bought 16 Ultimate yours and problems that, for some clips. B. was playing and processed orchestral music with irregular crackles (already in the import preview window and also in the finished film). All other media player and video editing software (eg. Nero B. 2014) give the same clip properlyagain and they work flawlessly. After many attempts to remedy the problem, I have now acquired 17 Ultimate despair in my studio, in the hope that you would have resolved the problem. Unfortunately, this is not the case. The clips crackle continue. I'm using Windows 7, with latest Graftik- and sound drivers. Can you help me here? If not, I beg you, tell me,I can again return to the product and the purchase price of Studio 17 Ultimate get refunded.

When setting parameters in timeline for (2D), I get a red band above the timeline (where the green rendering band normally is)? I can't find any reference to this in the online manual. Your advertising for S17 Ultimate claims "Live screen capture" - how? Again, no reference in manual. Not happy at this point, as I can see little difference in the upgrade for my$89Aus, and it certainly does not render 10 times faster - in fact, I cannot see any discernible difference to S16.

I was able to use the new software for 1 week. However, I wanted to remove a watchfolder and the contents because of the number of files in the folder taking too long to load. After I selected 'yes' to remove the content after I removed the watchfolder, the application froze and I cancelled. Since doing this I can no longer use the application, it freezes and does not load completely. I uninstalledthe main application and re-installed but that did not change anything. The application will not open completely, it just hangs until I have to close the program through the windows system manager.

I signed up for box.com through Pinnacle Studio 17 (export | sign up), but I only see the default 10 GB, not the 50 GB I should have gotten for buying PS17. How do I get my 50 GB of space?

Good day I made with Pinnacle Studio 17 my first DVD. Now I have problems with the disc menu. I can not select any menu item with the DVD remote, because he simply skips some. If I can try out in Studio 17 with the mouse, however, select each menu, but also menu items are skipped with navigation buttons. As a template for the disc menu I have "company three sub 16x9" used. Thank you for your help and greetings Roland Arnold

The links you sent to get a tutorial are unlinkable. I need a hard copy to read and learn from it is called a Tutorial "BOOK": HELP ME !

I recently upgraded to Studio 17 from 10 because I have a new computer running 64 bit W7. My input device is a DVC 150 but there doesn't seem to be a driver for it. I stayed with Pinnacle because I have the input device. How can I use the DVC 150? Regards, Brock Miles

under Studio 17. I didn't try now to make a film from a new project.Sirs, after installing correctly the Stdio 17 program, I could start it with no problems. First, I imported without problems a video-file from my video-camera. second, I opened a with no problems a project from Studio 14. Third, I maked without problems a DivX Video-film from the Studio 14 project. Fourth, I compiled a new projectunder Studio 17 and did a video-film from this new project without problems. Fifth, I started the update for Studio 17.0.1. This update ended with the error "Programme" is not a correct name for a short Data-file. And now I can't import any project from Studio 14. Studio 17 ends with the error "NGprogram terminates with error". I can start a new project 17. I didn't try now to make a film from a new project. What has gone wrong? Yours sincerely Gerd Brunschede

I have not been able to see my iPad video files in Pinnacle in order to import them. I can see the still photos on my iPad without difficulty, and can drag iPad files to my desktop on my PC then import them from there into the program. Is there a reason that I can't import them directly with the software?
